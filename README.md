# Pulse Splitter

The following schematic is for building a pulse splitter. This was designed specifically for splitting the pulse from a water meter into two separate outputs with an LED indicator. Watch the build on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qKo4LjSWZNY).

## Schematic
The schematic is using two AQV252G optocouplers for splitting the input into two outputs and a 4N37 optocoupler for the LED indicator (4N37 is cheaper).
